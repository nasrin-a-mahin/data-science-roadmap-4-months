# data-science-roadmap-4-months
Data science learning roadmap with real-world projects, notebooks, and Python scripts

📊 Data Science Roadmap – 4 Months (Job-Ready Portfolio)
🚀 Overview

This repository documents my 4-month structured journey into Data Science, designed to build job-ready skills through hands-on projects, real-world datasets, and end-to-end workflows.

Instead of focusing only on theory, this roadmap emphasizes practical implementation, business problem-solving, and industry best practices, aligned with current hiring expectations for Data Analyst and Junior Data Scientist roles.

🎯 Objectives

Build a strong foundation in Python and data analysis

Learn to clean, analyze, and visualize real-world datasets

Develop and evaluate machine learning models

Apply NLP, time series analysis, and web scraping

Create a professional, recruiter-ready GitHub portfolio

🧠 Skills & Technologies

Programming: Python

Data Analysis: NumPy, Pandas

Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn

Machine Learning: Scikit-learn

NLP: Text preprocessing, TF-IDF, sentiment analysis

Web Scraping: Requests, BeautifulSoup

Deployment: Streamlit / Flask (basic)

Tools: Jupyter Notebook, Git, GitHub
