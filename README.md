### Data Science Roadmap – 4 Months (Job-Ready Portfolio)
🚀 Overview

This repository documents my 4-month structured journey into Data Science, focused on building job-ready skills through hands-on projects, real-world datasets, and end-to-end workflows.

Rather than focusing only on theory, this roadmap emphasizes practical implementation, business problem-solving, and industry best practices, aligned with hiring expectations for Data Analyst and Junior Data Scientist roles.

🎯 Objectives

Build a strong foundation in Python and data analysis

Clean, analyze, and visualize real-world datasets

Develop and evaluate machine learning models

Apply NLP and time series analysis

Create a professional, recruiter-ready GitHub portfolio

🧠 Skills & Technologies

Programming: Python
Data Analysis: NumPy, Pandas
Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
Machine Learning: Scikit-learn
NLP: Text preprocessing, TF-IDF, sentiment analysis
Deployment: Streamlit / Flask (basic)
Tools: Jupyter Notebook, Git, GitHub
