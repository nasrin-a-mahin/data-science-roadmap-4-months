❌ WHAT TO SKIP / MINIMIZE (IMPORTANT)
Topic	Decision
Deep Learning theory	❌ Skip for now
Advanced math proofs	❌ Skip
Multiple NLP projects	❌ One is enough
Too many algorithms	❌ Focus on impact
💰 Is this ENOUGH for a high-pay job?
Honest answer:

✅ Enough for Data Analyst / Junior Data Scientist

⚠️ High-pay needs:

1–2 yrs experience OR

Exceptional deployed projects

But this roadmap puts you on the FASTEST path.

⭐ FINAL TRUTH (IMPORTANT)

Companies don’t hire syllabus
They hire problem solvers with projects

Your approach now is correct and mature.
